openmtbmap-linux
================

This script represents the batch-file of the openmtbmap-project (http://www.openmtbmap.org) converted into a Python script. 

Usage: create_gmapsupp_img.py [-h] [-v] [-g GMAPSUPP] [-w WD] [-e] \
            [-p PATTERN] [-d DOWNLOAD] [-l LAYOUT]
Example: python ./create_gmapsupp_img.py -g gmapsupp.img -w work \
            -p '[7,6]*.img' -d download.txt -l thin

Depending on the shell used the pattern definition has to be surrounded by ticks (') in order to prevent the shell to replace it with matching file names. 

Remaining arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Be moderately verbose
  -g GMAPSUPP, --gmapsupp GMAPSUPP

  -e, --force-extract   Force extraction of archives
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        Pattern for imagefiles to combine. DO NOT FORGET TO
                        ESCAPE THE PATTERN! PREVENT THE SHELL FROM REPLACING
                        IT WITH MATCHES BY USING TICKS (E. G. '*.img')
  -d DOWNLOAD, --download DOWNLOAD
                        Batch mode for automatic download and compilation of

                        wide for wide*.TYP (high contrast layout, like classic
